# Fall-Game
 Mobile game 
 
 I've developed a mobile game where players control a falling ball using the smartphone's gyroscope. A custom shader adds a captivating glow effect to objects, while object pooling optimizes performance. Player scores are stored on a server, and collected coins are saved locally. Users can purchase skins, and there's an option to watch ads for continued gameplay.
